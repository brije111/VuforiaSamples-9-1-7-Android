/// A type of ObjectTarget that recognizes and tracks objects by shape using existing 3D models.
/**
 * A Model Target tracks a real world object by its shape, based on a 3D model
 * of the object.
 *
 * In order to initialize tracking of a Model Target, the user is required to
 * position their device so that the object to be tracked appears in the camera
 * at a particular position and orientation. This initialization pose is called
 * a Guide View. To assist in this process, your application will typically
 * render an overlay in the camera image representing the position and
 * orientation of the object for the active Guide View. (Usually you will do
 * this by rendering the image returned by GuideView::getImage()).
 *
 * A Model Target dataset may contain multiple objects and/or multiple Guide
 * Views.
 * * If you have a Model Target dataset containing a single object with multiple
 * Guide Views, you can switch between the Guide Views using
 * setActiveGuideViewIndex().
 * * If you have an Advanced Model Target dataset with multiple objects and/or
 * multiple Guide Views, the activated Guide View changes automatically when
 * recognized.
 * * If you have an Advanced 360 Model Target dataset, no Guide View access is
 * necessary.
 *
 * \note
 * It is not possible to modify a ModelTarget while its DataSet is active. See
 * the DataSet class for more information.
