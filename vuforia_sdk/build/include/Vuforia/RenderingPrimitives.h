/// Provides low-level information and tools for rendering AR and VR content.
/**
 * %RenderingPrimitives provides a set of unified function calls that are
 * designed to work across all AR/VR display devices, including hand-held,
 * head-mounted (monocular/stereo) and wearable mobile devices.
 *
 * This means that you can write a single common rendering loop and have it work
 * across multiple output platforms, AR or VR, mono and stereo, with a minimum
 * of device-specific or context-specific code required.
 *
 * A valid %RenderingPrimitives instance can only be obtained from the Device
 * singleton instance after:
 * - the CameraDevice has been initialized, and
 * - %Vuforia has been informed of the rendering surface size via calls to
 * Vuforia::onSurfaceCreated() and Vuforia::onSurfaceChanged().
 *
 * The transformation measurement unit used is the same as the one used
 * to define the target size (usually meters).
