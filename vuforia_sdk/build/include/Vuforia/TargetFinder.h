/**
 * A TargetFinder identifies Image Targets in the camera feed. It can perform
 * detection and recognition, but is not able to track targets, nor provide
 * any kind of pose.
 *
 * A TargetFinder allows your application to support the detection and tracking
 * of a dramatically increased number of targets, by acting as a sort of filter
 * mechanism on the tracking environment. Based on the results of a TargetFinder
 * search, your application can selectively enable tracking for individual
 * targets *only when those targets are actually present* - avoiding expensive
 * and redundant tracking attempts for targets which are not present.
 *
 * A TargetFinder should be considered to operate asynchronously, offering
 * discrete results outside of the typical State lifecycle:
 * * TargetFinder results are not stored in the State.
 * * TargetFinder results may take several frames (or longer) to compute
 * (notably when using cloud-based image recognition) and may be delivered
 * asynchronously.
 * * TargetFinder results are delivered on-demand and must be explicitly
 * requested.
 *
 * Obtain a TargetFinder instance from the ObjectTracker by calling
 * ObjectTracker::getTargetFinder().
